// SECURITY HEADERS — TEMPORARILY REMOVED (2026-05-01 22:55 PT).
//
// MENU_LOG hypotheses #4–#6 (Referrer-Policy swap, jane:version meta tag,
// Clerk middleware scoping) didn't unblock Boost on the new Vercel deploy,
// despite identical bootstrap config to the still-working WP origin. The
// remaining cross-origin-affecting diff between WP responses and ours is
// these added security headers: WP sends NONE of them; we send four. The
// strongest suspect is `Permissions-Policy: payment=()` — Boost feature-
// detects the Payment Request API on init, and a blocking policy could
// abort hydration silently. Removing the whole block puts us byte-for-byte
// on WP's profile so we can confirm or rule out the policy class as a
// confound. Add back individually with confirmed-safe values once /menu
// is rendering products.

// Permissions-Policy verbatim from the still-working WordPress origin's
// /menu response (curl --resolve www.{domain}:443:208.109.64.51). Grants
// Private State Token redemption + issuance for Cloudflare's challenge
// endpoints — that's how iHeartJane's Cloudflare WAF verifies a real
// browser without CAPTCHA. Without this header, browsers default to
// "self only" and Cloudflare can't redeem the trust token issued during
// the page load → flags Boost's API requests as bot traffic → CORS
// rejection. This was the lone HTTP-header delta between WP (works) and
// our Vercel deploy (CORS-blocks).
