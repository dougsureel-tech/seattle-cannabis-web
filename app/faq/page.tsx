  {
    tag: "First Visit",
    q: "Do I need an ID to purchase cannabis?",
    a: "Yes. A valid, unexpired government-issued photo ID is required for every purchase. We accept driver's licenses, state IDs, passports, and military IDs. You must be 21 or older.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Payment",
    q: "What forms of payment do you accept?",
    a: "We are a cash-only dispensary. We have an ATM on-site for your convenience. We do not accept credit cards, debit cards, or digital payments.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Hours",
    q: "What are your hours?",
    a: `We're open every day ${STORE.hours[0].open}–${STORE.hours[0].close}, 365 days a year including holidays.`,
  },
  {
    tag: "Location",
    q: "Where are you located?",
    a: `We're at ${STORE.address.full} in Rainier Valley. Free parking in our lot. We're also walking distance from the Othello Light Rail Station.`,
  },
  {
    tag: "Discounts",
    q: "Do you offer veteran or military discounts?",
    a: "Yes — we're a veteran-owned business and proud of it. Active duty military, veterans, and first responders receive a discount. Just show your valid military ID or DD-214.",
  },
  {
    tag: "First Visit",
    q: "I've never bought cannabis before — is that okay?",
    a: "Absolutely. Our budtenders love helping first-time customers. We'll walk you through product types, dosing, how to consume safely, and what to expect. Just ask — there are no dumb questions.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Education",
    q: "What's the difference between indica, sativa, and hybrid?",
    a: "Indica strains are traditionally associated with relaxing, body-heavy effects. Sativas tend toward more energizing, uplifting effects. Hybrids fall somewhere in between. That said, terpene profiles and individual chemistry matter more than these categories — our staff can explain further.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Legal",
    q: "How much cannabis can I purchase at one time?",
    a: "Washington State law allows recreational customers to purchase up to 1 ounce of usable cannabis, 7 grams of concentrates, and 16 ounces of cannabis-infused products in solid form (or 72 ounces in liquid form) per transaction.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Legal",
    q: "Can I consume cannabis in your store or parking lot?",
    a: "No. Washington law prohibits consumption in retail stores, parking lots, and most public spaces. Please consume only in private residences where the property owner permits it.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Rewards",
    q: "Do you offer deals or loyalty rewards?",
    a: "Yes! Ask your budtender about our current deals and how to sign up for our loyalty program. Online orders also get 15% off automatically.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Ordering",
    q: "Can I order online for pickup?",
    a: "Yes — browse our menu at shop.seattlecannabis.co and place a pickup order to save 15% automatically.",
  },
  {
    tag: "Education",
    q: "How should I store cannabis products?",
    a: "Store in a cool, dark place away from heat and humidity. Keep in original packaging or an airtight container. Keep all cannabis products locked away and out of reach of children and pets.",
  },
