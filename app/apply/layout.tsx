// /apply has its own layout because `app/apply/page.tsx` is a client
// component (`"use client"` for the multi-step form state). Client
// components can't export `metadata`, so without this layout the page
// inherits the root layout's canonical (`/`) — Google then treats
// /apply as a duplicate of the homepage and refuses to index it as a
// separate page. Anyone Googling "Seattle Cannabis Co apply for job"
// would not find /apply in search results. /careers (sister page) is
// a server component and exports its own metadata; this layout makes
// /apply match the same canonical posture.
