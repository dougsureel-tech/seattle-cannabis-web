// Hack #7 — Heroes cohort SEO landing pages.
//
// Single dynamic route with generateStaticParams so each cohort gets:
//   - Its own canonical URL (/heroes/veterans, /heroes/teachers, etc.)
//   - Cohort-specific search-friendly title + description
//   - Hero copy that speaks to the cohort, not the program
//   - Eligibility table reduced to just the relevant rows
//   - FAQ overlay with cohort-targeted Q&A
//   - Sitemap-discoverable static prerender
//
// The mainline /heroes page still exists as the "all cohorts" overview;
// these are the long-tail SEO landings (veteran discount cannabis
// Seattle, teacher discount weed Rainier Valley, etc.) that capture the
// cohort-specific search before they ever see the program name.
//
// Per Doug's standing rule: don't lead with the dollar value — pitch the
// SIGNUP. Each cohort page leads with belonging + recognition, not the
// percentage off.
