            Washington&apos;s My Health My Data Act (HB 1155, in force 2024) defines{" "}
            <strong>consumer health data</strong> broadly — it includes anything that could
            identify a person&apos;s past, present, or future physical or mental health. Cannabis
            purchases at a state-licensed retailer fall inside that definition. This policy is the
            HB 1155-specific notice. Our broader privacy practices for non-health data are
            essentially the same and live on this page too — there is no separate &ldquo;general
