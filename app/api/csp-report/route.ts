// CSP violation report receiver. Browsers POST violation reports here
// when the page hits a directive in the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-
// Only` header (T108). Format per W3C CSP3 spec — the body is a JSON
// document with a `csp-report` key containing fields like `blocked-uri`,
// `violated-directive`, `document-uri`, `referrer`, `effective-
// directive`, `original-policy`, etc.
//
// Why log to console.error: Vercel auto-captures stderr from edge/node
// functions into Runtime Logs (Dashboard → Logs filter by function name).
// Doug can `vercel logs` or open the dashboard to grep for `[csp-violation]`
// during the 1-2 week observation window. This is the lightweight
// observation half of Doug-action #2.
//
// Future enhancement: persist violations to Postgres for a /admin/csp-
// violations dashboard with aggregated counts. Out of scope for T109 —
// the goal is just to capture the firehose so Doug can refine the policy
// before flipping to enforce mode.
//
// Anti-spam: cap log payload at 16KB; some browsers / proxies inject
// extension-fired violations that wouldn't help us tighten the real
// policy. 16KB comfortably fits real-shaped CSP reports. Oversize
// payloads are dropped (logged with size class so Doug can see the cap
// firing) rather than truncated and "repaired" with appended braces —
// the prior hack produced invalid JSON whenever truncation didn't land
// at the exact right nesting depth, so EVERY oversize report was
// silently dropped.
