    body: `## Cannabis in Washington State, in plain English

Recreational cannabis has been legal in Washington since 2012 (Initiative 502). Adults 21 and over can buy and possess up to 1 ounce of usable flower, 7 grams of concentrate, 16 ounces of solid cannabis-infused product (or 72 ounces in liquid form). Every retailer is licensed by the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB).

You'll need a valid government-issued photo ID every visit. Driver's licenses, state IDs, passports, and military IDs all work. We can't sell to anyone under 21 — bring the ID.

## Why Rainier Valley is a great place to shop

Rainier Valley sits along the Light Rail line and Rainier Avenue South, with Othello Station, Columbia City, Beacon Hill, and Mount Baker all walkable from each other. We're a transit-friendly neighborhood, which means a lot of customers walk in from the train. ${STORE.name} sits at ${STORE.address.full} with on-site free parking — so you can drive too if you need to.

## What dispensaries actually carry

A typical Washington dispensary menu has seven or eight categories. Here's what each one is for:

### Flower
The bud — dried cannabis flower, sold by weight. Typical sizes:
- **Eighths** (3.5 grams) — the most common purchase size
- **Quarters** (7 g), **halves** (14 g), **ounces** (28 g) — better per-gram price, larger commitment
- **Smalls** or **shake** — smaller buds or trim, lower price per gram, same flower

Smoke it, vape it in a dry-herb vape, or roll it into joints.

### Pre-rolls
Joints, already rolled. Singles or multi-packs. **Infused pre-rolls** add concentrate or kief on the inside or outside for a stronger experience.

### Vapes
Cartridges (510-thread) for a battery, or all-in-one disposables. Vapes typically run 60–90% THC and are the most discreet way to use cannabis. **Live resin** vapes preserve more terpene flavor; **distillate** is more potent but flatter.

### Concentrates
Pure cannabis extracts — wax, shatter, live resin, rosin, hash. Used with a dab rig, e-rig, or sometimes added to flower. THC typically 60–90%. **Live resin** is flash-frozen; **rosin** is solventless.

### Edibles
Gummies, chocolates, baked goods, beverages. Washington caps recreational edibles at 10mg THC per serving and 100mg per package. Onset is slower — wait 60 to 90 minutes before re-dosing. **First-timers should start at 2.5mg**.

### Tinctures, oils, capsules
Lower-key, often unflavored, used sublingually for faster onset than edibles. Common for sleep, recovery, or daytime micro-dosing.

### Topicals
Lotions, balms, transdermal patches. Most don't get you high — they're for localized relief.

## Reading a label

Every Washington cannabis product is required to show:

- **THC %** — 18–24% is typical for flower; 70–90% for concentrates and vapes.
- **CBD %** — usually low in flower (under 1%); featured in tinctures, topicals, and 1:1 products.
- **Strain type** — Indica (often relaxing), Sativa (often energizing), Hybrid (in between). The labels are looser than people think — terpenes and individual chemistry matter more.
- **Terpenes** — aromatic compounds that shape flavor and effect. Limonene = citrus, often uplifting. Myrcene = earthy, often sedating. Pinene = pine, clear-headed.
- **Producer name** — the licensed Washington company that grew or made it.
- **Lab test info** — every batch is tested. The certificate of analysis is on file with the WSLCB.

## How to pick something good

If you're new or unsure:

1. **Tell the budtender what you want from it.** "Help me sleep," "stay focused," "I'm going to a concert," "I want to cook dinner with friends." Effects-driven recommendations beat strain-name guessing.
2. **Start low, go slow.** Especially for edibles. 2.5mg is plenty for a first dose.
3. **Don't chase THC %.** A 32% flower isn't necessarily better than a 22% — terpenes and your tolerance matter more.
4. **Ask about freshness.** Recently-cured flower smokes better.
5. **Buy small first.** A pre-roll or eighth is a low-stakes way to try something new.

## Cash, ID, and what to expect

Cannabis is federally illegal, which means most banks won't process card transactions for dispensaries. Bring cash. ${STORE.name} has an ATM on-site, like most Seattle dispensaries.

When you walk in, you'll be checked in (we scan your ID — it's required by law and we don't store the photo or personal info). Then a budtender helps you pick. Browsing the cases is fine; asking questions is encouraged.

Consumption is **not** legal in retail stores, parking lots, or most public spaces. Take it home.

## Cannabis around South Seattle

The Seattle area has dozens of dispensaries — competition is healthy. ${STORE.name} is at ${STORE.address.full}, walking distance from Othello Light Rail, with free parking on-site, open 8 AM–11 PM every day including holidays.

If you're coming from elsewhere in the city: we're 10 minutes south of Beacon Hill, 5 minutes from Seward Park or Rainier Beach, 12 minutes from Columbia City, and a quick Light Rail ride from downtown. Park free, pick something up, ride home.

## Discounts

- 15% off online orders placed at our pickup site
- Veteran and active-duty military (with ID)
- First-responder discount (with ID)
- Loyalty rewards on every purchase

## Finally: the responsible part

Cannabis affects everyone differently. Don't drive impaired. Don't combine with alcohol if you're new — the interaction surprises people. Lock products away from children and pets — gummies look like candy, and dogs respond very poorly to THC.

    body: `## We're not a "carry everything" shop

A typical Washington dispensary can stock products from a hundred-plus licensed producers. We don't. We carry roughly 40–60 active brands at any given time, and we curate that list aggressively. Here's how we decide what makes the shelf.

## Five filters, in order

### 1. Quality of cure (flower) or extraction (concentrates)

For flower, we open jars. We look at trichome density, smell the cure, check for stems and seeds, ask about moisture content. A fresh-looking bag tagged with a recent harvest and cure date beats a name-brand jar of dry, brittle flower from six months ago.

For concentrates, we look at color, consistency, and smell. Live resin should taste like the plant it came from. Distillate should be clean. Rosin should be golden, not amber from heat damage.

### 2. Lab consistency

Every Washington cannabis batch is tested. We look at the **trend** — does this producer hit consistent THC and terpene numbers? Consistency is a tell for production discipline. We'd rather carry a 22% flower that's always 22% than a 28%-labeled flower that swings between 18 and 28 batch-to-batch.

### 3. Customer reorder rate

A first-time order is interesting. A second order is the real signal. If our customers don't buy a producer's product twice, we don't keep stocking it.

### 4. Pricing relative to category

Seattle is competitive. We won't carry an overpriced eighth that doesn't justify the premium against alternatives. The reverse is also true: we'll happily carry premium products at premium prices when the quality is there. It's the **value-to-price ratio** we judge.

### 5. The relationship

We work with producers we can call. When something goes wrong — a label error, an inconsistent batch, a delivery issue — we want a phone number that picks up. Vendors who treat us like a partner get more shelf space.

## What this looks like for you

When you walk in and see a strain on the shelf, it's there because:

1. We tasted it.
2. The lab numbers stayed consistent.
3. Customers came back for it.
4. The price made sense.
5. The producer is someone we trust.

We don't always get it right. Sometimes a producer goes off, or a strain stops hitting like it used to. When that happens we drop it and move on — usually our customers tell us first.

    body: `## What you're actually smelling

Walk into a dispensary and the first thing you notice is the smell. Pine. Citrus. Diesel. Pepper. Berry. That's not the THC — THC has barely any smell on its own. What you're smelling is **terpenes** — the aromatic oils every cannabis plant produces.

Terpenes aren't unique to cannabis. The same molecule that makes a lemon smell like a lemon (limonene) is in some cannabis strains. The molecule in pine needles (pinene) is in others. Lavender, hops, mango, black pepper, cloves — all the smells you know from non-cannabis plants — show up in cannabis too, in different combinations.

The interesting part: terpenes don't just smell. They shape how a strain *feels* when you use it. Two flowers can have the same THC percentage and feel completely different because their terpene profiles are different.

## The five terpenes worth knowing

You don't need to memorize the periodic table of terpenes. There are dozens, but five of them do most of the heavy lifting on the shelf:

### Myrcene — earthy, mango, herbal
The most common terpene in commercial cannabis. Carries a sedating reputation — the "couch-lock" feeling people associate with classic indicas. Found in mangoes, hops, lemongrass.

If a strain is described as "relaxing" or "heavy body" — myrcene is usually the headline.

### Limonene — citrus, sweet
Bright lemon-orange smell. Often described as uplifting, mood-elevating. Found in citrus peels (it's literally the same compound).

If a strain smells like fruit punch or lemon zest, limonene is doing the talking. Common in strains people use during the day or socially.

### Pinene — pine, sharp, fresh
What you smell when you crack a pine cone. There's some research suggesting pinene supports focus and clear-headedness, though anyone telling you it's a "concentration aid" is overselling — call it a hopeful association, not a prescription.

Common in old-school strains and Northwest-grown flower (no surprise — same biome).

### Caryophyllene — peppery, spicy, woody
Smells like cracked black pepper. The unusual one in the bunch — it interacts with cannabinoid receptors directly, which is more typical of cannabinoids themselves. Often associated with calming or grounding effects.

Found in black pepper, cloves, hops, rosemary.

### Linalool — floral, lavender
Lavender's signature compound. Less common in cannabis than the others, but distinct when present. Often associated with relaxation and evening use.

If you've ever picked up a flower that smelled almost soapy-floral, that's linalool.

## How to read a terpene label

Most Washington dispensaries (us included) print the top terpene on case cards or product detail pages. You'll usually see:

- A **percentage** — total terpenes by mass. Anything above 2% is high; 1.5–2% is good; under 1% is faint.
- A **dominant terpene** — usually the one above 0.5% by itself.
- Sometimes a **terpene chart** — the top three or four with bars.

A 22% THC flower with 2.5% terpenes is going to feel more interesting than a 30% THC flower with 0.8% terpenes. The terpenes shape the experience; THC sets the intensity. Both matter.

## "The entourage effect"

You'll hear this phrase a lot. The idea: cannabinoids (THC, CBD, etc.) and terpenes work together — the combination produces effects that neither would alone. There's evidence supporting parts of this theory and lots of overstatement around the rest. The honest summary: yes, terpene profile matters; no, nobody can predict exactly how a specific terpene combination will hit you specifically.

What that means for you on the floor: the menu's "indica/sativa" label is a starting point. The terpene profile is what tells you how a specific strain might feel. Two indicas with very different terpene profiles will feel different.

## Three practical reads

**1. Don't chase THC percentage alone.** Highest-THC isn't best — it's just most concentrated. A 24% flower with rich terpenes often beats a 32% flower with stripped-down terpenes for actual experience. Budget-conscious shoppers can save by picking on terpene profile rather than THC headline.

**2. Notice what you like.** Next time you have a strain you really enjoy, look up its terpene profile (we have it in the product detail). Pattern-match across a few sessions. You'll start seeing "I like myrcene-dominant flowers in the evening, limonene-dominant during the day" — that kind of thing. Way more useful than "I like indica."

**3. Ask the budtender.** If you walk in and say "I had a Blue Dream last month, it was great — what's similar?" — we can match you on terpene profile, not just strain name. That's how we steer you toward something you'll like even when the specific strain isn't in stock.

## Limitations

Cannabis hits everyone differently — body chemistry, tolerance, mood, and what you ate matter as much as the chemistry of the flower. Terpenes are a useful organizing concept, not a personality test. Treat the descriptions here as starting points, not promises.

Nothing on this page is medical advice. Cannabis isn't FDA-approved for any condition. Talk to a healthcare provider for medical questions.

    body: `## The single rule that prevents a bad edible night

**5 milligrams of THC. Wait two hours. Then decide.**

If you read nothing else on this page, that's it. The most common bad-edible experience in our store's twelve years of operation has the same shape every time: a customer ate something, didn't feel anything in 30 or 45 minutes, ate more, and got hit with the original dose plus the second dose ninety minutes later. By the time they realize they overdid it, the timeline isn't on their side.

Edibles are slow. They feel slow because they *are* slow.

## Why it takes so long

When you smoke or vape cannabis, the THC reaches your bloodstream in about three to ten seconds. That's why you feel it almost immediately. You can dose by feel — one hit, wait, decide.

Edibles go through your digestive system. Your stomach has to break down the food, your small intestine has to absorb the THC, your liver metabolizes it. Best case: 30 minutes if you're on an empty stomach. Average: 60 to 90 minutes. With a heavy meal: up to 2 hours, occasionally more. There's no way to speed this up.

Worse, the THC your liver produces from edibles (called 11-hydroxy-THC) tends to feel stronger and last longer than the THC you get from inhaling. So you wait an hour, you don't feel it, you have another — and now you've doubled your dose right before *both* doses peak. That's the textbook overdose-by-accident.

## Starting doses, by experience level

These are starting points. Everyone's body chemistry is different — what feels mild to one person can feel intense to another.

| You are… | Start with… | Wait | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Brand new to cannabis** | 2.5 mg | 2 hours | Most people feel something around 60–90 min |
| **First-time edible, smoke regularly** | 5 mg | 2 hours | Inhaled tolerance ≠ edible tolerance |
| **Occasional edibles** | 5–10 mg | 2 hours | Whatever was your last comfortable dose |
| **Regular edibles** | Your usual | 90 min | You know your body |

Notice the wait time is **two hours** for everything in the "less experienced" rows. Not one hour. Two.

## Reading a Washington edible label

Every legal edible in Washington is required by WSLCB to be packaged so individual servings are 10 mg of THC or less, and the total package can't exceed 100 mg. So a 100 mg gummy package is 10 servings, not one big gummy.

What to look for:
- **Per serving** — usually shown clearly on the front (5 mg, 10 mg).
- **Total per package** — for budgeting + storage planning.
- **Servings per package** — confirms the math.
- **Onset time** — sometimes printed; usually 30–120 min, fast-acting can be 15–45 min.
- **Best by** — edibles last months but lose potency over time.

If a chocolate bar is 10 mg per square and you want a 5 mg starting dose, you eat half a square. Cut it before you cook anything yourself — that's how people accidentally take too much. Most modern edibles are made to be easily portioned this way.

## Faster-acting edibles

The newer category is "fast-acting" or "nano-emulsified" edibles — usually drinks, sometimes gummies. The cannabis is processed into smaller particles that absorb partially through your mouth and stomach lining instead of fully through your liver. Onset can be 15 to 45 minutes instead of 60 to 120.

The starting-dose rule still applies: 5 mg, wait — but the wait can be shorter (45 minutes instead of 2 hours). Don't let "fast-acting" trick you into not waiting.

## Common over-dose scenarios (and how to handle them)

If you took too much, you're not in medical danger — there are no documented fatal cannabis overdoses in adults. But the experience can be intensely uncomfortable: anxiety, racing heart, paranoia, occasionally nausea or dizziness. It will pass, usually in 4 to 8 hours.

What helps:
- **Stay somewhere safe and quiet.** No driving. Don't try to handle stressful tasks.
- **Hydrate.** Water, juice, anything non-caffeinated.
- **CBD if you have any handy.** Some people report it takes the edge off — the evidence is mixed, but it's harmless to try.
- **Black peppercorns.** Old folk remedy with surprising support — chew a few peppercorns. The caryophyllene appears to interact in a way that calms the THC effect for some people.
- **Sleep through it.** If you can lie down, do.
- **Time.** This is the main one. The peak is 2 to 4 hours after ingestion; you'll feel the worst of it ease around hour 4.

When to actually call someone:
- If breathing or heart rate feels seriously off — call a doctor or 911. Cannabis itself isn't usually the cause, but if it triggered a panic attack severe enough to scare you, that's worth a phone call.
- If a child or pet ingested cannabis — that's an emergency room visit. Their bodies aren't built for adult doses.

## Things people get wrong

**"I have a high tolerance from smoking, I can take more edibles."**
Inhaled tolerance and edible tolerance are different metabolic pathways. People who smoke daily have been surprised by 10 mg edibles. Start at 5.

**"It's been an hour, I'll just take a little more."**
This is the most common mistake. Wait the full two hours. There's no harm in being early and patient; there's plenty of harm in being early and impatient.

**"I'll eat it on an empty stomach so it works faster."**
Mostly true — but the dose hits *harder* on an empty stomach, not just faster. If you're new to edibles, eat something light beforehand to mellow the curve.

**"More milligrams = better experience."**
No. Past a certain point, more THC mostly means more side effects (anxiety, faster heart rate, dry mouth) without proportionally more of what you actually want. Find your dose, stay there.

**"Edibles wear off in two hours."**
They peak around 2–4 hours and the body is still processing them up to 8 hours later. Plan accordingly — don't take an edible at 9pm if you have a 7am meeting.

## What we recommend on the floor

If you've never had an edible, walk in and tell us. We'll point you at a 5-mg gummy or a halvable 10-mg square, sell you the smallest available pack, and remind you of the 2-hour wait at checkout. That conversation has prevented a lot of bad nights.

For first-timers we usually steer toward:
- A balanced THC/CBD product (a 5:5 or 1:1 ratio softens the edge a bit)
- Fruit-flavored gummies at 5 mg (easy to dose, easy to read the label)
- Skip the high-dose 100 mg/serving products even if you "think" you need more

## A note on what this isn't

Nothing on this page is medical advice. Cannabis isn't FDA-approved for any medical condition. If you're taking medications — particularly anything with CYP3A4/CYP2D6 metabolism, blood thinners, or sedatives — talk to a pharmacist or doctor before adding edibles to your routine. They interact with more medications than people realize.

If you're pregnant, nursing, or trying to conceive, the WSLCB warning on every legal package applies: don't.

## The conversation we'd rather have

We'd rather you come in, ask which 5 mg gummy is good for a first edible, walk out spending $5, and have a great Saturday night — than overdo it, swear off edibles forever, and tell five friends edibles are awful. Most people who've had a bad edible night had it because nobody warned them. Now you know.

[Check the live menu](/menu) for current edibles + fast-acting drinks. If you want a budtender's pick, [come visit](/visit) and tell us your starting line. That's the right conversation to have at the counter, not in a parking lot reading a label.

    body: `## The two-bucket story you've heard

Walk into any dispensary and you'll get the same elevator pitch:

- **Indica** — body high, relaxing, "in da couch," for nighttime
- **Sativa** — head high, energizing, social, for daytime
- **Hybrid** — somewhere in between

It's a useful shorthand. It's also wrong often enough that taking it as a guarantee will get you a strain that does the opposite of what you wanted. Here's the honest version.

## Where the indica/sativa labels actually come from

Originally, indica and sativa were botanical terms describing two regional cannabis subspecies — *Cannabis indica* (short, broad-leaf, mostly from south-central Asia) and *Cannabis sativa* (tall, narrow-leaf, mostly equatorial). The terms described the *plant*, not the *effect*.

Over decades of breeding — especially the last twenty years of intense indoor cultivation — almost everything on a Washington dispensary shelf is a hybrid of those two ancestors. The "pure indica" and "pure sativa" you see labeled today often share more genetics than the labels suggest.

What stuck around is the *experience association*. Old-school growers noticed indica-leaning genetics often produced relaxing, body-focused effects, while sativa-leaning genetics often produced more cerebral, energetic effects. That association became the marketing language. The chemistry it was based on, though — is mostly about *terpene profile*, not the indica/sativa label itself.

## What actually predicts the experience

Three things are doing the heavy lifting:

**1. THC and CBD content.** THC is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid; CBD takes some of the edge off. A 30% THC flower with no CBD will hit harder than a 18% THC flower with 4% CBD even if the labels are flipped. CBD-dominant strains feel almost completely different from THC-dominant ones regardless of indica/sativa labeling.

**2. Terpene profile.** The aromatic compounds (myrcene, limonene, pinene, caryophyllene, linalool — see [Terpenes 101](/blog/terpenes-101)) shape how the strain feels far more reliably than the indica/sativa label. A myrcene-dominant strain tends to feel sedating regardless of whether it's labeled indica or sativa. A limonene-dominant strain tends to feel uplifting either way.

**3. Your body chemistry, set, setting.** What you ate, your mood, your sleep last night, what you're doing while you use it. These matter more than people admit. Two friends sharing the same joint will report different experiences.

## Why the labels still work as a starting point

If terpenes do the actual work, why do indica/sativa labels still hold up at all?

Because the breeding tradition baked in correlations. **Most** indica-labeled strains are bred for myrcene-heavy profiles. **Most** sativa-labeled strains are bred for terpenes that lean uplifting (limonene, pinene). Not always, but often enough that the label is a useful first filter.

What you should NOT do is treat the label as a guarantee. The label is "what category did the breeder pitch this as." The terpene profile is "what's actually in the jar."

## How to read a strain like a pro (in 30 seconds)

When you're standing at the case looking at a flower, here's the order of operations:

1. **THC %.** Is it where you want it? Higher isn't better — somewhere in the 18-26% range is plenty for most people. Above 28% you're trading flavor for intensity.
2. **Terpenes.** Do they list a top terpene or terpene chart? Match that to what you're trying to feel:
   - Want relaxing → myrcene, linalool, caryophyllene
   - Want uplifting → limonene, pinene
3. **Indica/sativa label.** Treat it as confirmation, not the headline. If terpenes say "relaxing" and the label says "indica" — likely matches the marketing claim. If they conflict, trust the terpenes.
4. **Brand reputation.** Does this brand have a reputation for matching their labels to actual experience? Some are more careful than others. Your budtender can tell you.

## A few real-world examples

**"Wedding Cake" (typically labeled indica, hybrid in WA):** Often heavy myrcene + caryophyllene. Lives up to the relaxing rep most of the time. Marketing aligns with chemistry.

**"Blue Dream" (typically labeled sativa-leaning hybrid):** Often myrcene-dominant despite the sativa lean. Many people find it more relaxing than the label suggests. The label undersells the body component.

**"Sour Diesel" (typically labeled sativa):** Often limonene + caryophyllene profile. Tends to deliver on the energizing rep. Matches the label well.

**"Northern Lights" (typically labeled indica):** Often myrcene + caryophyllene. Classic sedating profile. Matches the label.

The takeaway: the label is right *most* of the time but you'll find counter-examples in any dispensary. Reading the terpene profile catches those.

## What to ask the budtender

Skip "do you have any good sativas?" — it's the wrong question. Try:

- "I want something for daytime that won't put me on the couch — what terpene profiles should I look at?"
- "I had Blue Dream last month and it was exactly right — what's similar?"
- "I'm new to cannabis, want a relaxing evening, prefer not to feel anxious — what would you recommend?"

Those questions get you to the answer faster because they describe the *outcome* you want, not the bucket you think predicts it.

## Where the labels DO matter (still)

Despite all the above, the indica/sativa label has practical uses:

- **Quick scanning of menus** — most dispensary websites filter by it. Useful for narrowing 200 SKUs to 30.
- **Brand consistency** — same brand's "indica" line tends to be similar across strains. Once you find a brand whose indica matches your preference, the label is more reliable within that brand.
- **Communicating with budtenders who don't know you** — saying "I want a sativa" is faster than explaining your terpene preferences. The conversation can deepen from there.

## Why dispensaries still print the label

Two reasons. First, customers expect it — pulling the label off the menu would confuse far more people than it would educate. Second, the WSLCB labeling rules implicitly accommodate it, and changing how cannabis is categorized industry-wide takes a long time.

A few brands and labs have started publishing terpene charts directly on the package. When you see those, that's the brand betting on terpene-literate customers. We carry several brands that do this; ask your budtender to point them out.

## Bottom line

The indica/sativa label is a useful starting filter and a misleading prediction. Treat it as the front door of the conversation, not the answer. The terpene profile, THC/CBD ratio, and your own experience over a few sessions will tell you more than the bucket name ever will.

Nothing on this page is medical advice. Cannabis isn't FDA-approved for any condition. Effects vary by person.
