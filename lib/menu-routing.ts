// Interim ordering surface = iHeartJane Jane Boost at /menu (until the native
// menu launches). The live Boost embed silently swallows every deep-link query
// param (?strain= ?brand= ?category= ?q= ?vibe=), so any on-site element that
// promises a SCOPED product view — deal product cards, strain "in stock" cards,
// brand filters, the vibe quiz — actually dumps the customer on the FULL
// unfiltered menu. Clicking several of these in a row feels like the site keeps
// sending you to the same wall ("loops, can't order" — SCC PM lead shift report
// + staff complaints 2026-06-08). Until the native menu (which DOES honor these
// params) is live, collapse every scoped target to a clean bare /menu: no false
// scoping promise, no /order redirect hop.
//
// REVERSIBLE BY DESIGN: flip NEXT_PUBLIC_NATIVE_MENU_LIVE=true at native-menu
// launch and every CTA restores its original scoped deep-link in one env edit —
// no code revert. Doug 2026-06-08: "this stuff will likely come back as soon as
// we launch our menu so that can be a part of our planning."

 * scoped promise. Wrap the RESULT in withAttr() as before to keep attribution.
