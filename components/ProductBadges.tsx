// Customer Engagement Layer Ship 2 — public-site badge renderers.
//
// Two badges on a single product card:
//   - **Budtender's Pick** — green pill, top-row hierarchy. The shop
//     voice ("we") is the brand-voice doctrine but the pick is a
//     deliberate budtender act — so the social-proof variant says
//     "Picked by N regulars" instead of personalizing the budtender
//     name. (We don't have the budtender name on the public site's
//     product list — it lives on the PWA "Picked for you" card; this
//     surface is the discovery surface.)
//   - **New This Week** — neutral chip, sits inline with potency chips
//     for visual density.
//
// **WAC 314-55-155 sanity** — "Budtender's Pick" is staff endorsement
// of a product we carry (operational, not efficacy claim). No "best
// for X" or "great for Y" framing. The text "Picked by N regulars" is
// social proof, not a medical/efficacy framing.
//
// **Brand voice** — `docs/brand-voice.md` (shared across both stores)
// calls for warm + direct copy. "👋 Budtender's Pick" reads relational
// without exclamation; "✨ New this week" reads conversational. No
// "Try this!" or other CTA framing.
//
// Sister of `greenlife-web/components/ProductBadges.tsx` — byte-
// symmetric (badges read the same regardless of which store renders
// them; the data behind them differs because each store's brapp has
// its own Neon DB).
//
