// Loyalty arc — surfaces the relationship-based tier vocabulary
// (Visitor → Regular → Local → Family) on the public site so the
// language a customer sees on the homepage matches the language they'll
// see at the POS / on receipts / in /account once Clerk live keys land.
//
// Per `Inventory App/docs/brand-voice.md`: relationship arc, not metals.
// Never "Gold" / "Silver" / "VIP" — that's chain-vibe, not us. Tiers
// here are stripped of the lifetime-spend numbers (POS sees those) so
// the public-site copy reads as story, not ladder.
//
// Marketing-log finding 2026-05-02: tier vocab is half-deployed —
// wired to POS + /account but absent from public-site marketing
// surfaces. This component closes the gap on the highest-traffic
// surface (homepage). Brand pages + /deals + footer get the same
// language by reference, not by their own component.
