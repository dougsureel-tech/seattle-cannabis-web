// Customer-facing strain co-purchase rail. Phase 2 Ship 2.4 of the Strain
// Tree arc (sister of the admin Markov dashboard at /admin/reports/
// strain-co-purchase, Phase 1B.3, v428.5205).
//
// Renders below StrainInStockSection + above the FAQ on /strains/[slug]. The
// rail surfaces the top 5 partner strains by lift > 1.0 from THIS store's
// basket-level Markov data. Each partner card delegates to the SSoT
// `<StrainCard variant="compact" />` primitive — type chip + name + 1-line
// tagline. The chip-row hierarchy matches the rest-of-site V2 strain
// surfaces (A-Z hub + quiz result) so customers feel one consistent card
// language across the journey. Migrated to the primitive 2026-05-28
// (Round 2 of the StrainCard SSoT arc); previous version used a bespoke
// eyebrow-dot pattern for the type indicator which diverged from the
// V2 hierarchy.
//
// Voice: "People who pick {strain_name} also reach for these" — PATTERN
// observation (preference-as-fact about past customer behavior), NOT effect
// claim. WSLCB 314-55-155 safe — no causation framing, no medical adjacency,
// no efficacy verbs. Mirrors the verb-of-preference rubric from
// STRAIN_COPY_VOICE_RUBRIC_2026_05_15.md.
//
// Honest empty-state contract: when fewer than 2 partners survive (insufficient
// basket signal, all partners fell below lift floor, transient API failure),
// renders NOTHING. No "1 partner" lonely-card state. No "insufficient data"
// placeholder. No "loading" skeleton. The page simply doesn't show the rail
// for strains that haven't accumulated enough basket signal yet — which is
// honest: the math isn't ready, so we don't pretend it is.
//
// Privacy: no customer counts, no purchase frequencies, no transaction IDs
// surfaced to customers. Pure strain-pair surfacing — same data the admin
// dashboard renders, but with the operator-only fields (basket count, lift
// value, confidence) stripped before display.
